# Pyber Analysis  

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the relationship between the type of city and other things, specifically the number of fares earned, the number of drivers, and the number of rides given. The intent is to determine whether there are any patterns that can be uncovered for the purpose of improving Pyber's services and profitability via e.g. increasing ridership in areas where there is room for growth.





Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

More than half of the rides given took place in urban cities. Only a fifth of the rides took place in the surburbs. Although more than 60% of the fares earned were from rides given in urban cities, the average fare per ride was higher for rides given in the surburbs and rural areas. The average fares that drivers earned per ride was significantly higher for rides that took place in rural areas than in urban areas.

Despite a majority of the rides taking place in urban cities, weekly earnings in rural areas were sometimes more than half of what was earned in urban areas. 

## Summary 

Some of the potential ways in which Pyber can change to improve revenue and better serve passengers include the following: 
- Expand the business more in rural areas, as the average fare per ride and driver is significantly higher than the averages for urban and surburban areas. This may increase the overall total fares earned. 

- Promote the ride-sharing business more in surburban areas, as the average fare per ride is higher in comparison to urban areas. This may increase the overall total fares earned in surburban areas, and thus increase the overall total fares earned.

- Change the pricing setup so that higher fares are charged depending on the type of area the ride is taking place. For example, charging higher prices for rides in rural and surburban areas may incentivize drivers to pickup riders who are requesting rides in more underserved areas and improve coverage and overall fares earned in those areas.
